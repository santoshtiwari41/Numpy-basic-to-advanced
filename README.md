## Introduction to Numpy

Numpy is a fundamental library for numerical computing in Python. It provides powerful tools for creating, manipulating, and analyzing numerical data, ranging from simple arrays to complex multidimensional operations.

### Key Features:
- Fast numerical computations.
- Support for multidimensional arrays.
- Comprehensive mathematical functions.
- Linear algebra, Fourier transforms, and random number capabilities.

## Basic Usage

### Creating Arrays
- **1D, 2D, and 3D Arrays:**
```python
array_1d = np.array([1, 2, 3])
array_2d = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
array_3d = np.array([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]])
